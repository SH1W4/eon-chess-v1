# Symbiotic Framework

## Overview

The Symbiotic Framework is designed to facilitate seamless integration between heterogeneous systems, enabling a symbiotic relationship that enhances functionality and performance. This framework leverages the strengths of individual systems through shared capabilities and adaptive evolution.

## Key Concepts

1. **Symbiotic Core:** The engine that manages resources, capabilities, and interactions between systems.

2. **Host and Guest Systems:** Defined roles for systems in a symbiotic relationship, allowing flexible integration strategies.

3. **Emrgence Patterns:** Strategies for adaptive improvement and optimization based on system interaction metrics.

4. **Phases of Symbiosis:** 
   - **Nucleation:** Initial integration phase.
   - **Symbiogenesis:** Formation of a symbiotic relationship.
   - **Emergence:** Development of adaptive behaviors.
   - **Homeostasis:** Long-term stability and efficiency.

## Workflow Blueprint

### 1. Nucleation Phase
- **Objective:** Establish initial connection and compatibility analysis between systems.
- **Triggers:** On system load or demand.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Initialization of core capabilities.
  - Compatibility analysis.

### 2. Symbiogenesis Phase
- **Objective:** Develop resource-sharing strategies and operational bridges.
- **Triggers:** Post-analysis completion.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Integration of resource management.
  - Synchronization of state monitoring.

### 3. Emergance Phase
- **Objective:** Evolve adaptive behaviors through continuous analysis.
- **Triggers:** Metrics thresholds.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Facilitation of symbiotic emergence.
  - Evaluation of system cohesion.

### 4. Homeostasis Phase
- **Objective:** Maintain balance and ensure the continuous smooth operation.
- **Triggers:** Continuous monitoring
- **Key Actions:**
  - Collecting vitals and stability metrics.
  - Adjusting resources dynamically.

## Usage Examples

### Command-line Initialization
```bash
symbiotic init --host=/path/to/host --guest=/path/to/guest --mode=full
```

### Status Monitoring
```bash
symbiotic vitals
```

### Emergence Facilitation
```bash
symbiotic emerge
```

## Adaptive Strategies
- **Resource Optimization:** Dynamic resource allocation based on real-time analysis.
- **State Synchronization:** Aligning system states for coherence and efficiency.
- **Event Harmonization:** Conflict resolution and event management across systems.

## Configuration and Customization
- **Workflows:** YAML for defining phases and transitions.
- **Capabilities:** JSON schemas outlining shared capabilities and roles.
- **Emergence Patterns:** JSON configuration of adaptive emergence strategies.
